  Mewsie, juniper, Baylee...A rose by any other name you know me by is just as sweet.<br><br>
  I do not consider myself a programmer, but rather 
  <a href="https://alanbeckley.com/thinkers-tinkerers-and-inventors/">a tinkerer</a>.
  I do, however, come from a long legacy of Inventors and real Programmers, some of which <a href="https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Via+Joseph+La&oq=assignee%3A%28Via+Joseph+La%29">their patents are still on Google for public archival</a> [ <a href="https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Jr+Joseph+La+Via">X</a> ] [ <a href="https://patents.google.com/?assignee=La+Via+Joseph">X</a> ].The Programmers primarily worked with proprietary software in Commercial Enterprises, as well as Military Operations and Encryption.<br><br>
  
  <!-- You unlocked a secret: More backstory!
  
  As a result of my family history, I always felt growing up that I had big shoes to fill. Heights I knew I could possibly accomplish, had I only had the discipline, courage, or strength to make the choice to do so. I learned bits of code growing up--building websites on backdoor forums for only maybe a handful of people to ever see in their lifetimes, most of which lost to time. I can still read what's given in front of me, kind of, and can kind of understand what's going on, but writing it? Huge challenge. AI helps. Hopefully, it will help more in the future. I want to make open-source tools and freeware for people that were in my shoes once to be able to use and bring pride to my family with what I accomplish so that they one day talk about me with reverence and so that I feel that like I have earned every word.

<h3 align="left">ðŸŽ­  Sob Backstory & Other Important Lessons</h3>

###

<p align="left">
At the age of 4, my father built me my first computer for my own usage (so maybe 2000-2001?) and I haven't been able to get off the thing for too long ever since. My first friends came to me not in real life but in the form of cute online characters and sprites in a game called Trickster Online. To this day, I will not forget their generousity, many people who were twice my age at the time if not even older, who gave me the time of day and a home to return to at the end of the day that made me want to keep beating my own drum. Without going too far into it, it helped being a mentally ill child being surrounded by mentally ill teens and adults who just...didn't want anything out of you but your companionship. Even then, if they didn't, they still tolerated it, cause they saw how you showed up every day without fail and knew that it <em>mattered</em>, at least to you. I ended up feeling like, with my chaotic home life, that my only home was, in fact, this silly little town in silly little pixels with my silly little friends from all around the continent who came to my silly little patch of graphics in the game just to chat with silly little me. It's silly, <em>but it mattered</em>. And I'm going to make sure it mattered.<br><br>
-->

<h4 align="left">I have also learned, overtime, after stumbling so many times, so much so that I came to a few conclusions:</h4><br><br>

1. There is no such thing as "perfection" as society deems it. There is only dreams, and what is truly perfect is what of our dreams we make into a reality.<br>
2. It is ok to get down the first day, and the second day, and the third, if it means you're going to come out the fourth day standing stronger than an oak tree. Taking time to recover is important, and progress is not linear.<br>
3. Progress is messy. Real progress. That shows up in code, too; I'm not a programmer, but I'm not ignorant of that.<br>
4. Success is determined by the amount you can make your dreams a reality that fufills your soul, not just your cardinal wants.<br>
5. Weapons, are still catagorized as tools, and can be used appropriately under the right mindset and careful hands. This means I have no problem using AI as my assistant. There is much more to this opinion, but this is the basic jist.<br>
6. I am not a shame or a burden to the people close to me for not learning the things I wanted or needed to in the time <em>someone else</em> dictated. I have no reason to look at my time clock and rush myself, nor do you, so why should we? You can't rush perfection.<br>
7. My brain is not like other brains. This makes me both a liability to the worst and an asset to the best.<br>
8. I am allowed to live by my own umbrella of labels, given not by God or man, but my own hand.<br>
9. The truest self lies in ritual, habituation, and discipline.<br>
10. I have no idea what I'm doing, but I know what I'm building for, and I'm going to go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JH6il8U3EU0">The Distance</a> to get there.<br>
11. <strong>No one is beyond redemption</strong>. Not until you're dead, but even then, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:People_who_have_received_posthumous_pardons">there's still a chance</a>. I think society doesn't give enough of these to people who can, do, and should matter, and I won't let those people be left behind like I was.
